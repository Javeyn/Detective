A choose your own adventure style game

Alright ladies and gents. I've shook off the Post Coding Bootcamp PTSD. You know the questions! Questions such as:

"Did I make a huge mistake?"

"Did I waste my money?"

"Am I ever going to be any good at this?"

We found out that those questions dont really mattter. In the end, we all did learn something, maybe more than what we learned before, and now we gotta use it.

SO! That brings you here. I talked all sorts of mad shit about making a game, and I honestly started to make 3. But they all required skills I dont have... yet. So lets start simple. 

This is going to be a clicky style choose your own adventure game. It will have a short story to follow, and only a few correct paths to take. 

It will be simple, and hopefully somewhat entertaining. I hope you enjoy.
