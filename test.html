            You've recently been working a case involving a club in South NJC.
            An influx of high power firearms has made its way into the city, and
            violent crimes have skyrocketed. You and your partner suspect that
            the club owner is involved, a man who goes by the name of Mr Don.
            Mr. Don has been tied to organized crime all throughout the city.

          <div id="story3">
            A reliable source down at the South NJC Port has contacted you about
            rumors of large arms purchases. At 11pm tomorrow night, a large
            container ship will be arriving. On this ship will be a containers
            with over $500,000 dollars worth of large firearms and ammunition.
            Coincidentally, Mr. Don has a container on this very same ship,
            shipping 3 "large antique vehicles".

            partner and his “Friend” are gone. The body still remains, as well
            as the murder weapon.

            Your most recent cases have had you deep undercover. Deep enough
