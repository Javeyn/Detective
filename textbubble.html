      The year is 198X. Welcome to New Jet City.
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      You are a detective at the 11th police precinct in New Jet City. Your most
      recent cases have had you deep undercover. Deep enough that many of your
      fellow officers question your integrity as a police officer. Look, you've
      gone through some crazy things, but your a good cop. I mean, you are a
      good cop....right?
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      You've recently been working a case involving a club in South NJC. An
      influx of high power firearms has made its way into the city, and violent
      crimes have skyrocketed. You suspect that the club owner is involved, a
      man who goes by the name of Mr Don. Mr. Don has been tied to organized
      crime all throughout the city.
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      A reliable source down at the South NJC Port has contacted you about
      rumors of large arms purchases. At 11pm tomorrow night, a large container
      ship will be arriving. On this ship will be a containers with over
      $500,000 dollars worth of large firearms and ammunition. Coincidentally,
      Mr. Don has a container on this very same ship, shipping 3 "large antique
      vehicles".
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      You and your partner go to your boss to pitch the idea, and hes less than
      impressed. "Last time I went out on a limb for you two, I fell flat on my
      face. This better pan out." he warns you. You let him know there is no
      need to worry. The source has provided you with a manifest of the shipping
      container. The port is expecting a delivery of 6 large containers, but the
      manifest seems to not account for 2 of the containers, including Mr.
      Don's.
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      The ship arrives at 11:18pm, and the raid is flawlessly executed, with one
      glaring exception. When all the dust finally settles, there are no guns,
      and there are no antique cars. You've been duped again.
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      The next day your boss really lets you two have it. There was a lot of
      yelling at him by his boss, so of course, there is going to be a lot of
      yelling directed at you. You decide it is probably best if you lay low for
      a while. Except...
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      Later that day your source from the pier calls you. At 10:36pm last night,
      an emergency reroute was called in to divert 2 containers from Port South
      to Port West. Your guess is that someone in the precinct warned Mr. Don
      about the raid, and he was able to get his guns safely moved. You decide
      to go to Port West to look for clues.
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      Port West turned out to be a big waste of time, so you head back home.
      When you walk into your house, you can hear the tail end of a message
      being left on your message machine. When you press play on the machine, a
      familiar voice comes through...
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
      "Hey, it's your partner John. There have been some developements in our
      case, you need to call me at my house. Call me right now." You pick up the
      phone and call John. "I'm glad you called," He starts," I think I found
      one of the sellers for the guns. I am going to try to buy some, and I need
      you to be my backup."
    </div>
    <div class="textBubble">
     Its almost too good to be true. You grab your pistol, your badge, and your jacket, and you head out the door.
